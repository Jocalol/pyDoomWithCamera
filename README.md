(An alternative camera playable version of) [Raycasting DOOM imitation](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Python-DOOM)

# How to Play

In order to play this iteration of DOOM, it is necessary that you have a somewhat single-colored object that stands out from the background in order for it to be detected by the camera.
This color is determined by the "`COLOR`" setting in `settings.py`, which has a preset of different colors to choose from, depending on the color of your chosen object.
